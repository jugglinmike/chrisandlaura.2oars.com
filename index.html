				</header>
				<blockquote>
					"Tu de este lado y yo del otro como dos remos,"
					Trans. "You on one side and I on the other, like two oars."
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					This verse is featured in Love Park in Lima, Peru, which
					was conceived by Peruvian poet Antonio Cill&oacute;niz.
					Chris and Laura visited the park in 2009 after graduating
					from Harvard together, and they continue to be amazed at
					how appropriately the quote they discovered there applies
					to their relationship.  Both active in the intramural
					sports community in college, Chris and Laura became friends
					while co-captaining the Lowell House crew team--their heads
					together planning boat lineups, early morning workouts on
					the Charles River, and big team breakfasts characterized
					their first interactions together. It was one such early
					morning in 2008 when Chris asked Laura to Lowell's spring
					formal, the Bacchanalia.
				</p>
				<p>
					The happy couple has been together ever since, their
					relationship growing and flourishing with equal support and
					love from port and starboard sides. Together for three
					years in Cambridge and Boston, they parted ways to pursue
					higher education in Atlanta and Philadelphia-- Chris on one
					side of the Mason Dixon Line and Laura on the other-- and
					after two years they emerged even stronger and more
					resolute in their love. They are so excited to begin their
					Happily Ever After-- together again, at last-- in the city
					of Atlanta, Georgia, where they will remain until Chris
					completes his MD/PhD at Emory University.
