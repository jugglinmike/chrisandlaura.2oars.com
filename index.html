					<h3>Our Story</h3>
				</header>
				<div class="content">
					<blockquote>
						"Tu de este lado y yo del otro como dos remos," Trans.
						"You on one side and I on the other, like two oars."
					</blockquote>
					<p>
						This verse is featured in Love Park in Lima, Peru,
						which was conceived by Peruvian poet Antonio
						Cill&oacute;niz.  Chris and Laura visited the park in
						2009 after graduating from Harvard together, and they
						continue to be amazed at how appropriately the quote
						they discovered there applies to their relationship.
						Both active in the intramural sports community in
						college, Chris and Laura became friends while
						co-captaining the Lowell House crew team--their heads
						together planning boat lineups, early morning workouts
						on the Charles River, and big team breakfasts
						characterized their first interactions together. It was
						one such early morning in 2008 when Chris asked Laura
						to Lowell's spring formal, the Bacchanalia.
					</p>
					<p>
						The happy couple has been together ever since, their
						relationship growing and flourishing with equal support
						and love from port and starboard sides. Together for
						three years in Cambridge and Boston, they parted ways
						to pursue higher education in Atlanta and
						Philadelphia-- Chris on one side of the Mason Dixon
						Line and Laura on the other-- and after two years they
						emerged even stronger and more resolute in their love.
						They are so excited to begin their Happily Ever After--
						together again, at last-- in the city of Atlanta,
						Georgia, where they will remain until Chris completes
						his MD/PhD at Emory University.

							<h4>Alexandra Bassett</h4>
							<h5>Maid of Honor</h5>
						</header>
						<p>Laura is so excited to have Alexandra as her Maid of
						Honor. The two have been best friends for the past
						twelve years, starting in Fort Lauderdale where they
						went to high school together and were on the same State
						Champion eight on their crew team. Through college they
						kept up their relationship between Boston and
						Brunswick, Maine, by visiting each other every
						semester, sharing in many great adventures. Laura was
						delighted when Alexandra moved to Boston after
						graduation, where they were able to continue their
						adventuring&mdash;often with the addition of Chris and
						his friends! Alexandra is currently in her fourth year
						at Tufts University School of Dental Medicine, and is
						definitely the most exciting dentist Laura knows. She
						enjoys skiing black diamonds, hiking 14'ers, and indoor
						rock climbing, and still finds time for her favorite
						stationary passion, studio art.</p>

							<h4>Alexandra Kress</h4>
							<h5>Bridesmaid</h5>

						<p>Laura is absolutely delighted to have her dear
						friend Alix in her bridal party. Laura and Alix met at
						PennDesign, where Alix's creative side kept Laura
						focused on the details, and her stoic personality kept
						Laura grounded during late nights in the lab or
						studio&mdash;especially during the last month of
						thesis! Both committed in long distance relationships,
						Alix and Laura were often spotted on coffee dates or
						long walks, comparing notes on cute things to send
						their boyfriends. Both girls have since closed the gaps
						in their romantic relationships, moving to fun new
						cities for their wonderful men, and are so excited
						about each other's new lives! Alix is currently working
						at a Design/Build firm, and in her free time she enjoys
						photography, ice cream, and being in the great
						outdoors&mdash;all of which are available in abundance
						in Bozeman, Montana.</p>

							<h4>Christine Beckman</h4>
							<h5>Bridesmaid</h5>
						</header>
						<p>Christy and Laura met during orientation week at
						PennDesign, where they were fortuitously assigned to
						the same group to hunt for a drawing subject: in this
						case, a cute Philadelphia rowhouse. Their drawing
						skills grew immensely after that first week, and so did
						their friendship. The pair partnered up in virtually
						every class from that day on, as labmates and measuring
						partners, and learned a thing or two from each other as
						well! Christy's adventurous nature succeeded in
						bringing Laura out from under her graduate-school rock
						many a weekend, and together they explored
						Philadelphia's touristy attractions and delicious
						culinary offerings. Christy enjoys anything that has to
						do with mountains (she recently moved back to Colorado,
						her home) and is an excellent baker&mdash;Laura still
						dreams about Christy's homemade pretzels and doughnuts,
						and is so excited to have Christy's smiling face next
						to her on her wedding day!</p>

							<h4>Erica Dee</h4>
							<h5>Bridesmaid</h5>
						</header>
						<p>Erica and Laura first became friends in sophomore
						English class, basking in the praise of their teacher
						who clearly favored rowers to the other high school
						students. They were brought together by their shared
						enthusiasm for fantasy novels and punk rock&mdash; in
						High school they were the oldest kids dressed up for
						each Harry Potter midnight book release party, and the
						coolest kids at the beach the next morning, eating ice
						cream and comparing notes on the last few chapters.
						They quickly grew out of their spiky bracelets and
						ripped jeans, but their relationship&mdash;and book
						recommendations&mdash;continue to this day, with
						frequent visitations between New York and Boston, New
						York and Philly, and now New York and Atlanta. A
						Manhattan convert after four years at NYU, Laura thinks
						Erica likely will remain in the city forever&mdash;but
						she still maintains that Boston is “a nice place to
						visit sometimes.” Laura is absolutely delighted that
						Erica will be next to her on her big day.</p>

							<h4>Erika Boltz</h4>
							<h5>Bridesmaid</h5>
						</header>
						<p>Erika and Laura were brought together in 2009 by
						their goofy boyfriends, Andrew and Christopher, who had
						been friends since childhood. When Andrew and Chris
						moved in together after graduating from college, they
						had no idea that it would have such wonderful
						consequences, but when the girls met it was basically
						love at first sight. Erika and Laura both share a
						healthy love of dogs, vegetables, and cute
						apartments&mdash;attributes which have arguably made
						their boyfriends' lives much better! They are both
						waiting patiently for Andrew and Chris to bring home
						nice canines to make their lives complete. Erika and
						Andrew have recently moved to the Chicago area (back to
						Erika's home state!) and Laura and Chris are elated
						that their favorite double-date couple will be
						brightening their wedding party all the way from the
						Midwest.</p>

							<h4>Kirsten Harmon</h4>
							<h5>Bridesmaid</h5>
						</header>
						<p>Laura is thrilled that her oldest friend Kirsten
						will be in her wedding party. The two have been friends
						since they were five years old&mdash;the day they met,
						their moms found them holding hands on the stairs of
						the church auditorium. They soon became inseparable,
						growing up together like sisters and sharing all kinds
						of happy memories, like playing soccer, softball and
						dress-up, singing and dancing in musicals, and going to
						sleep away camp for the first time. After Laura moved
						away from California, the two continued to lead
						parallel lives in their academic interests and travel
						destinations&mdash;both minored in Latin American
						Studies and have traveled extensively in Central and
						South America since graduation. They joke that their
						mothers are co-presidents of the "I Lost My Daughter to
						Latin America" club. Since their untimely separation at
						age 13 they have reconnected in full force&mdash;you
						can't stop a love that lasts forever!</p>
